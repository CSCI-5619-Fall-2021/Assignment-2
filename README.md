# Assignment 2: Create a Virtual Environment

**Due: Thursday, September 30, 10:00pm CDT**

The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain experience creating virtual environments in Unity.  Your goal is to create your own virtual environment using free 3D art assets found on the web.  You will also implement some basic locomotion using the [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@1.0/manual/index.html).  If you get stuck on any of the steps in this assignment, you should go back and watch the video for [lecture 5](https://github.com/CSCI-5619-Fall-2021/Lecture-5).

You are free to use any legal sources for third party assets, including the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/).  Alternatively, you can also locate and export game assets from websites such as [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) and [Clara.io](https://clara.io/).

Creativity is encouraged!
